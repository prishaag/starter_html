            <p> There are 5 boroughs within New York City, including Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, Queens, Bronx. Each borough is filled with different sights to see. New York City has 
                many opportunities not only for those who live there, but also those visiting. From navigating the subway system 
                to seeing a Broadway show, it is impossible to get bored. You can find the original image of the Brooklyn bridge at <a href ="https://www.investopedia.com/commercial-property-slumps-6836400">Investopedia</a> </a></p>
            <!-- <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p> -->
