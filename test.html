            <h3>Geographical Location: New York, United States of America</h3>
            <p>New York City, otherwise known as “The Big Apple,” is a bustling city in the United States of America. Home to about 8 million people, New York City houses popular attractions such as the statue of liberty, central park, the empire state building, and many more. </p>
            <p> There are 5 boroughs within New York City, including Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, Queens, Bronx. Each borough is filled with different sights to see. New York City has many opportunities not only for those who live there, but also those visiting. From navigating the subway system to seeing a Broadway show, it is impossible to get bored. </p>
            <!-- <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p> -->
